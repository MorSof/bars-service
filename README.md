## Bars Service

### Run all services with docker compose

#### Prerequisites

Before you run on docker, make sure that you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Pull and run from dockerhub

```shell
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up
```

On the first time running this, the app container should be failed:

1.  Go to the DB section below and follow the orders there
2.  ```shell
    $ docker-compose down
    $ docker-compose up
    ```

Now all the containers should work!

The service is exposed on http://localhost:3001

OpenApi (Swagger) is exposed here http://localhost:3001/api

3. On the general tab name your server "rings_quest"
4. On the connection tab:
   - **Host name/address**: db
